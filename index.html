      <img class="picture1" src="./images/uc_berkeley_eecs_logo.jpg">Steve Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, in <b>1950</b>. He received a BS in electrical engineering and computer science
      from UC Berkeley (1986).<br></p>
      <p class="font"><img class="picture1" src="./images/grad-cap-confetti-2-01.png">Wozniak (”Woz”) built his first computer when he was 13 years old, and was an electronics prodigy in high school. At 19,
      he met 14-year-old Steve Jobs and the two teenagers built an electronic “blue box” enabling them to hack the public
      telephone network and make toll-free calls.<br></p>
      
      <p class="font"><img class="picture1" src="./images/logo-ucberkeley.png" ></imm><b>1971</b>:At Berkeley he was best known for his larger-than-life escapades around campus.When not attending class, studying or using
      Berkeley’s top supercomputer, the future co-founder of Apple Computer was staging elaborate pranks and building gadgets,
      known as “blue boxes,” which allowed fellow students to make free long-distance calls.<br></p>
      <p class="font"><img class="picture1" src="./images/apple-computer-logo-1D72BA50BC-seeklogo.com.png"><b>1975</b>:Wozniak began developing his first major project: the Apple I. One year later, he and Jobs co-founded their own company,
      Apple Computer, and began selling the rudimentary systems out of Jobs’ garage. The promise of this new microcomputer led
      Wozniak and Jobs to commit to designing a more refined product, known as the Apple II.<br></p>
     <p class="font"><img class="picture1" src="./images/1024px-HP_logo_2012.svg.png"><b>1976</b>:after his second year, Wozniak, also known as “Woz,” had to take a leave from Berkeley to earn money for school. During
      that hiatus — which was intended to only last a year — he worked for a few electronics companies before taking a job at
      Hewlett-Packard. He also designed his own microcomputer, which eventually became the Apple I. To launch the product, he
      and his friend Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computer</p>
      <p class="font"><img class="picture1" src="./images/2750800-200.png"><b>1977</b>:The Apple II was introduced by Wozniak and Jobs and that featuring a central processing unit, a keyboard, color graphics and a floppy disk drive. Its groundbreaking engineering
      combined with visual appeal propelled Apple Computer’s market value to record-breaking success.<br>

      <p class="font2"><img class="picture1" src="./images/galati-romania-april-29-2023-600nw-2295394661.webp"> While at the helm of Apple, Jobs led the company in developing groundbreaking products, including the iPod, iPhone, and
      iPad.</p>
      <p class="font2">Jobs founded the NeXT computer company, which developed an operating system that Apple eventually acquired to boost its
      personal computers.</p>
      <p class="font2"><b>2006</b>:Wozniak published his autobiography, iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded
      Apple, and Had Fun Doing It.</p>
      <p class="font2"><b>2020</b>:He founded EFFORCE, which allows companies to fund energy efficiency projects through investing in a cryptocurrency
      token using blockchain technology.</p>
      <p class="font2">Not one to flaunt his personal life, Wozniak is married to Janet Hill, an Apple education development executive. Wozniak
      has made appearances on the reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List and ABC's Dancing with the Stars (Season
      8).</p>
