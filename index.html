  <p class="quote1">"Your first projects aren't the greatest things in the world, and they may have no money value, they may
    go nowhere, but that is how you learn - you put so much effort into making something right if it is for yourself."</p>

    professionals don't have."</p>
    <h3  class="main">I)History of Steve Wozniak </h3>
    <ul class="font">
      <li>Steve Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, in <b>1950</b>. He received a BS in electrical engineering and computer science
      from UC Berkeley (1986).</li>
      <li>Wozniak (”Woz”) built his first computer when he was 13 years old, and was an electronics prodigy in high school. At 19,
      he met 14-year-old Steve Jobs and the two teenagers built an electronic “blue box” enabling them to hack the public
      telephone network and make toll-free calls.</li>

      <li><b>1971</b>:At Berkeley he was best known for his larger-than-life escapades around campus.When not attending class, studying or using
      Berkeley’s top supercomputer, the future co-founder of Apple Computer was staging elaborate pranks and building gadgets,
      known as “blue boxes,” which allowed fellow students to make free long-distance calls.</li>
      <li><b>1975</b>Wozniak began developing his first major project: the Apple I. One year later, he and Jobs co-founded their own company,
      Apple Computer, and began selling the rudimentary systems out of Jobs’ garage. The promise of this new microcomputer led
      Wozniak and Jobs to commit to designing a more refined product, known as the Apple II.</li>
      <li ><b>1976</b>:after his second year, Wozniak, also known as “Woz,” had to take a leave from Berkeley to earn money for school. During
      that hiatus — which was intended to only last a year — he worked for a few electronics companies before taking a job at
      Hewlett-Packard. He also designed his own microcomputer, which eventually became the Apple I. To launch the product, he
      and his friend Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computer</li>
      <li><b>1977</b>The Apple II was introduced by Wozniak and Jobs and that featuring a central processing unit, a keyboard, color graphics and a floppy disk drive. Its groundbreaking engineering
      combined with visual appeal propelled Apple Computer’s market value to record-breaking success.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3  class="main2">II)Contribution and fact of Steve Wozniak</h3> 
    <ul class="font2" >
      <li>While at the helm of Apple, Jobs led the company in developing groundbreaking products, including the iPod, iPhone, and
      iPad.</li>
      <li>Jobs founded the NeXT computer company, which developed an operating system that Apple eventually acquired to boost its
      personal computers.</li>
      <li><b>2006</b>Wozniak published his autobiography, iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded
      Apple, and Had Fun Doing It.</li>
      <li><b>2020</b>he founded EFFORCE, which allows companies to fund energy efficiency projects through investing in a cryptocurrency
      token using blockchain technology.</li>
